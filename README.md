Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of breast cancer using various machine learning models. The objective is to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors based on given input features, ensuring early detection and diagnosis.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains features extracted from cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and more.
The target variable is Malignant (1) or Benign (0).
